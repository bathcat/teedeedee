This is a concept-based solution. Key points:
  - The interface is represented as a concept, canvas::Turtle
  - The consumer canvas::DrawingContext is templatized, requiring the concept
  - No need for an adapter class (not yet), since the third-party library matches the concept

Pros:
  - No runtime overhead
  - No boilerplate
  - Abstractions are captured
  - Nice error messages

Cons:
  - Needs > C++20
  - Concepts are still new to developers and toolchains
  - Eventually, we may need to create an adapter component
