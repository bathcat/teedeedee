# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Learn how to define the iterative and quality-focused software development methodology of TDD.

## Course Overview:
The Test-Driven Development training course demonstrates how it can be used to create high quality software.
The course begins with an examination of common test terminologies, practices, benefits, and pitfalls. The course then moves into a discussion on the theory and practice of Test-Driven Development (TDD). It also covers the applicability of TDD in modern software development paradigms, and how it can be leveraged within different software engineering processes. Once the foundation has been laid, the TDD course transitions into a hands-on learning lab. Finally, students learn the processes and practices of TDD in the creation of a basic application.
